# angular-graphql

This is basically a fork of [arjunyel](https://github.com/arjunyel)'s repo, with my own modifications. Link to the original repo is [here](https://github.com/arjunyel/angular-spacex-graphql-codegen).

This web app uses SpaceX's [public GraphQL API](https://api.spacex.land/graphql/) to display a list of the past SpaceX launches along with an associated details page. Data is provided via the SpaceX GraphQL API and Angular services are generated via [GraphQL Code Generator](https://graphql-code-generator.com/). [Apollo Angular](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/angular/) is used to access data from the frontend.

An excellent [tutorial video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wzR4Ig5pTI) is on YouTube by [Jeff Delaney](https://github.com/codediodeio), check it out to get started with GraphQL!
